        <p> "The pull up bar is perfect for my tiny home gym :) and they were great with customer service, stayed in close contact with me for a week after purchase as I was figuring out how to install it." - Iris </p>
        <P>"Franky N’s design of the adjustable doorway pull up bar is exactly what I have been looking for several years. As a wheelchair user with severe foot drop and balance issues, my mobility is a work in progress. It is important to safely strengthen my muscles as much as possible, especially my legs. Now I can! I’m grateful to have found this product: - it’s low profile, and doesn’t obstruct the doorway at all - the neutral color is not an eyesore, so I’m not going to paint it - it’s adjustable, so I can use it as a grab bar to stand from my wheelchair, which is helpful for strengthening my legs - Franky N was very helpful and responsive, so my husband was able to secure it to the door frame, after using enough screws - shipping was expensive, but I was more than happy to pay because I really need this pull up bar. I’m happy!" -Darcy</P>
